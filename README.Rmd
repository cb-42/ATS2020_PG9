# ATS2020_PG9
This is a guide for acquiring the course materials for ATS 2020 PG9: A HANDS-ON INTRODUCTION TO STUDYING THE LUNG MICROBIOME

# Pre-course preparation
Prior to starting the section entitled Hands-On: A Crash Course in Microbiome Analysis: Part 1 several pieces of software need to be acquired.

## I. R
First you'll need to acquire R itself. This can be done directly from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## II. RStudio
Secondly, install the free desktop version of [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

## III. Course Package
Finally, the course package needs to be installed. To do this, open RStudio then copy, paste the following R code into the console, and then enter the code to execute it.

First, install the devtools package if needed, then load it:
```
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

Next, install and load the course package.
```
install_github("https://github.com/cb-42/NAME_TBD")  
library(NAME_TBD)
```

This package includes all of the data and code necessary to follow along during the hands-on session.
